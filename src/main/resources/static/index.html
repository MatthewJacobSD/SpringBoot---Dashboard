<h1>Dashboard</h1>
<p>This project has been separated into two main parts backend and frontend<br />
    The frontend is being handle by a Next.js project while the backend is being handled by the SpringBoot Project</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Overall struggled to get into Spring Boot but managed to get along with a couple of video tutorials to support me
        </li>
        <li>
            Used AI when I couldn't find the answer online more specifically where about formatting the code structure and grasping how to use Spring Boot in general
        </li>
        <li>
            The idea of using Next.js was for the UI Css only, I transitioned from a JavaFX project to this one because it lacked the styling I desired so most of the files where copy and paste from there with a little of tweaks to add the annotation required
